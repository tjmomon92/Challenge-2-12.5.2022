Challenge #2 of the SMU Fullstack Coding Bootcamp
# <Stuart Momon Portfolio>

## Description

- My Main motivation for this project was to learn through doing. I learned an incredible amount putting this website together and am excited by the progress that I am making in my coding skillset. This project was not only a great learning tool, but also a professional asset that I can expand upon and grow as my skills increase. A professional portfolio page is a great way to show practical skills in-action, as well as a firm grasp of fundamentals and design. A personal webpage such as this that can be updated is a perfect method of tracking ones progress, especially during times of discouragment. I learned much throughout this process, but my most noteworthy "ah-ha" moments revolved around soft-skills such as patience, problem-solving, and finding my own answers.
